BOUNCING BALL
The physics of a bouncing ball concerns the physical behavior of bouncing balls, particularly its motion before, during, and after  impact against the 
surface of another body. Several aspects of a bouncing ball's behavior serve as an introduction to mechanics in high school or undergraduate level physics
courses. However, the exact modelling of the behavior is complex and of interest in sports engineering.

The motion of a ball is generally described by projectile motion (which can be affected by gravity, drag, the Magnus effect, and buoyancy), while its impact is
usually characterized through the coefficient of restitution (which can be affected by the nature of the ball, the nature of the impacting surface, the impact velocity, 
rotation, and local conditions such as temperature and pressure).

To ensure fair play, many sports governing bodies set limits on the bounciness of their ball and forbid tampering with the ball's aerodynamic properties.
The bounciness of balls has been a feature of sports as ancient as the Mesoamerican ballgame.
